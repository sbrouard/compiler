The aim of this project was to create a compiler from C to LLVM, as we only had fe weeks to conduct this project only the main C features were managed.

Ths sources of the project are in the 'fusion' repository.
The 'hash' repository contains the hash table that we used.
The 'llvm-to-js' contains a compiler form llvm to JavaScript that alloawed us to test our results with a graphic intereface.
